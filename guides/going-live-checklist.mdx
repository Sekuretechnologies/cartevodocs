title: Production Checklist
description: Pre-launch verifications before going live.
---

Before switching to the production environment, ensure that all the following steps have been completed.  
This checklist helps minimize risks associated with deployment and ensures a smooth integration.

---

## Wallets

- [ ] Verify the configuration of required wallets (by currency, user, or entity).
- [ ] Confirm that initial balances and fund management rules are correctly defined.

---

## Collections

- [ ] Test collections in the sandbox with various scenarios (successful payment, failure, invalid amount).
- [ ] Ensure that API statuses correspond to the expected outcomes.

---

## Transfers

- [ ] Test internal transfers (within the same organization).
- [ ] Test transfers between different wallets (e.g., customer â†’ seller).
- [ ] Verify the consistency of amounts and currencies.

---

## Notifications and Statuses

- [ ] Verify receipt of notifications (webhooks) for each event type (transaction, collection, transfer).
- [ ] Ensure your system correctly handles status updates (pending, success, failed).
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to retry or catch up in case a webhook is missed.

---

## Security and Monitoring

- [ ] Confirm the use of production API keys.
- [ ] Ensure all communications go through HTTPS/TLS.
- [ ] Enable logging and set up an alert system for critical errors.
