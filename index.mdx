curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/wallets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "USD",
    "country_iso_code": "US"
  }'

```

Lister les transactions d’un portefeuille (Node.js)

```javascript
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const res = await fetch(
  `${process.env.BASE_URL}/wallet/transactions/wallet/${process.env.WALLET_ID}`,
  {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}` },
  }
);
const data = await res.json();
```
