# Environments

Cartevo provides two distinct environments to support development, testing, and live operations.

---

## **Preproduction**

The **Preproduction** environment allows you to test your integrations in conditions that closely mirror production.  
Use it to validate workflows, verify API calls, and ensure your systems function as expected before going live.

> ⚙️ **Note:** In the Preproduction environment, wallet balances are limited to **50,000 XAF** (approximately **80 USD**).  
> This limitation helps keep your test operations safe, controlled, and predictable.

---

## **Production**

The **Production** environment is where real operations take place, with no limitations on balances or transactions.  
All transactions and funds are real — just like in Preproduction — but this environment is intended exclusively for fully verified integrations and actual business use.
