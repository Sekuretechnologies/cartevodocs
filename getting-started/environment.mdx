# Environments

Cartevo provides two distinct environments to support development, testing, and live operations:

- **Preproduction**:  
  This environment replaces the old sandbox. It allows you to test your integrations in near-real conditions with limited transaction amounts.  
  Use Preproduction to validate workflows, test API calls, and ensure your system behaves correctly before going live.

- **Production**:  
  The live environment where real transactions take place.  
  Make sure all your integrations have been fully tested in Preproduction before using Production.
