## Authentication

Authentication is a mandatory step to interact with the Cartevo API.  
All requests must include a **Bearer Token** sent in the HTTP `Authorization` header.  
Without this token, your calls will be rejected with an authentication error.

### Expected Format

The token must be included in each HTTP request as follows:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
